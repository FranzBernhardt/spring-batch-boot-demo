# Spring Batch Demo

This is a little demo on how to use Spring Batch. A kind of a "Hello-World" setup.

Created for course teaching Java (Spring Framework) and Data/Business Intelligence (Power BI).

It demonstrates how Spring Batch can be used as an ETL tool towards data analysis (for example in Power BI) 

_Enjoy!_
